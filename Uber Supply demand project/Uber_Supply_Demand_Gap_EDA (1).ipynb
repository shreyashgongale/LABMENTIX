        "4) As we know already that the count for pickup point city is greater than airport and here we can see that the maximum count of cancelled trips is for city pickup point which shows a bad impression that customer requests are not followed by drivers, this can ultimately reduce company rating so as to avoid this company should monitor on drivers who cancelling rides inside city commute so as to increase future customer engagement and overall company reputation.\n",
        "5) Maximum cars are not available at airport pickup point where the most of the business comes for any cab service company, so if uber wants to increase its profits it should provide more number of cars at airport so as to not miss the opportunity of earn and retain frequent flyers who commute through airport and use cab services.\n",
        "6) No cars available status is mostly for evening/ night time, cancelled status is mostly for morning time and Trip completed status has equal no of count for both evening/ night and morning time. As per this morning drivers should be monitored constantly and they should be informed that to minimize the cancellation of cab service.\n",
        "7) Airport and city pickup point both have high count for morning/ afternoon drop timestamps, which means customers are reaching their destination/ arrivals in the morning/ afternoon time. Remembering this drivers should be informed that not to cancel morning requests as it will impact company profits.\n",
        "8) The drop time is morning for all three status which means cancelled trips are mostly done in the morning which affects the business as most customers are travelling in the morning, the company should inform the drivers that if they cancel trips in morning than they have to face penalty as this will reduce cancellation and ultimately increase profits for the company.\n",
